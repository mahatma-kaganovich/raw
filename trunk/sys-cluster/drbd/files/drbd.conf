# "yes" to force primary if configured even if no UpToDate node connected
# I use with dual-primary & "wfc-timeout 0;" for HA/emergency degraded primary
DRBD_FORCE_PRIMARY="no"

# "status" - wait for stable state (vs. after split-brain syncing, etc)
# "primary" - "status" or primary=OK - faster dual-primary double start
# "none" - no wait (old Linbit's way)
# "status" is most safe (default)
