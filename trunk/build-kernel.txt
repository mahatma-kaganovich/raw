This overlay installing overlayed kernel-2.eclass with useflag
"build-kernel" to automated kernel make on emerge time. It must work
with any "sys-kernel/*-sources" package, using kernel-2.eclass.

=== Configuring kernel.

Configuration starting by "make defconfig", then going optional kernel
config fixes and "make oldconfig" (after each fix). Last - "genkernel ramdisk"
to gentoo initrd behaviour (todo: make own ramdisk?) with optional fixes.

=== Config options.

There are two variables: KERNEL_MODULES, KERNEL_CONFIG.
(see defaults in my "kernel-2.eclass").

KERNEL_MODULES contains directory list to wildcard modules enable.
If "+" prefix given - modules will be forced, else - only unset
will be modules (this path is around incomplete current modules lists in
genkernel, some of default built-in modules needs to still built-in).

KERNEL_CONFIG contains kernel configuration options, prefixed by
none ("y"), "-" ("n"), "+" ("m"), "~" (remove/oldconfig-default).
Also perl regular expressions (for "grep -P") may be used.

First reading "/etc/make.conf" values. If empty - using defaults. Then
trying "/etc/kernels/kernel.conf".

Default config trying to be kernel default + maximum hardware & filesystems.
To use pure kernel defaults add to "/etc/make.conf":
KERNEL_MODULES="vanilla"
KERNEL_CONFIG="vanilla"
(or other unused keyword)

Present behaviour IMHO must be most simple and configurable.

Current defaults checked by kernel 2.6.20 (kerrighed-sources).

=== Compiling.

Compiling must be usual "make all" + "genkernel ramdisk",
installing into /boot and /lib/modules. No /boot mounting checks right now.
Just copy into mounted /boot by hand (subject to self-check too).

=== Addons.

Useflag "integrated" make initrd image to built-in into kernel.

Useflag "pnp" add pnp/pci/etc. module bootloader, based only on
prepared kernel modules info (no external hardware data).

Useflags "pnp" and "compressed" will force all kernel modules to include
into initrd, compressed by "cramfs" or "squashfs" (related of kernel version).
Since only new kernels support compressed initrd - implemented
only universal mode - compressed "/lib" directory inside uncompressed
initrd and mounted runtime by script. I see no sence to do extra path
to compress all initrd (little extra kilobytes).

Useflag "netboot" make Gentoo's netboot image (not yet verifyed,
todo: include Kerrighed modules and tools too, but tools must be
static).

Kernel cmdline option: "nopnp".

P.S. Defaults are subject to change.
