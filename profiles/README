this is my profile, created primary for own systems sync.
But anybody can use it too.

WARNING!! Some developers hate this multiple CFLAGS and will
say you multiple bad words. Some software hate it too and you
can copy it into own make.conf, removing "-Ofast -ffast-math"
first (need to be filtered or -fno-fast-math for some packages).

Althernate profile way (2do - main):
/etc/portage/make.profile -> /usr/ppatch/profiles/{native,cpu}
/etc/portage/make.profile.common -> /var/lib/layman/raw/profiles/common/{broken,other,fast,unroll}
/etc/portage/make.profile.target -> /var/lib/layman/raw/profiles/targets/*
/etc/portage/make.profile.gentoo -> /usr/portage/profiles/* (/usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/*/13.0)
